# Install
The current package can be fetched directly from your R session. If not already
present, first install the devtools-package from your R terminal:

  install.packages("devtools")

Most R packages at Rapporteket will depend on the "rapbase" package. If not
already present, install the "rapbase" package from github:

  devtools::install_github("Rapporteket/rapbase")

To install the current package, first time or at any future upgrade, do:

  devtools::install_github("Rapporteket/[package-name]", ref = "rel")


NOTE: Communicating through a proxy might cause the above install command to
fail. If so, try the following prior to the above install command:
  
  library(httr)
  set_config(
    use_proxy(url="18.91.12.23", port=8080, username="user",password="passwd")
  )

replacing the example parameter values with whatever applies for the
system the package is being installed on
